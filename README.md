# Blogger-content

This Git / GitHub repo is to store exports from Blogger, as well as associated collateral - particularly posts as something more editable


My intention fo rthis repo is to - periodically - do a full export from Blogger.com of my space - [](https://simon-northampton.blogspot.com) - which will facilitate moving teh content, or reimporting it, should I need to.

I also inted to - separately - keep hold of teh actual articles, as indivdual things.  I will write the articles as markdown (MD) and I can then keep track of how a particular article evolved.
